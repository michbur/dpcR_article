\begin{abstract}

The digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) enables an absolute 
quantification of nucleic acids. Different statistical analysis frameworks
were proposed. However, most analysis is done in closed source software as 
provided by the vendors. This makes it harder to compare results, such as the 
confidence interval estimates. An unified open software framework for 
reproducible research is not available.

To perform dPCR analysis we implemented peer-review statistical methods and 
plots into the \textit{dpcR} framework, based on the sophisticated statistical 
computing environment \textbf{R}. \textit{dpcR} is versatile open source 
cross-platform software framework, which provides functions to process dPCR 
data 
independent of the hardware. Our software can be used for data analysis and 
presentation, as framework for novel technical developments and as reference 
for 
statistical methods in dPCR analysis. Features such as functions to estimate 
the 
underlying Poisson process, calculation of confidence intervals based on single 
samples as well as on replicates, a novel Generalized Linear Model-based 
procedure to compare dPCR experiments and a spatial randomness test for 
assessing plate effects have been integrated. We use a plug-in like 
architecture 
and abstraction layers to make the framework usable for droplets and 
(real-time) 
chamber based technologies.

\textit{dpcR} is implemented with interfaces to the command-line, graphical 
user interfaces and interactive web application. Therefore, it can be used by 
novices in a graphical user interface or by experts via a command-line 
interface. The \textit{dpcR} framework can be used to build a custom-made 
analyser according to the user requirements. \textit{dpcR} is an 
open framework, which can be easily adapted to the growing knowledge in dPCR.

\section{Introduction}

The digital PCR (dPCR) is an important contender for precise nucleic acids 
quantifications. Application of the dPCR include investigation of allele 
frequencies, single-cell analysis, gene expression analysis and absolute 
quantification of PCR products. The chemical basis (e.g., buffer, primer) of the 
dPCR and thermal cycling is similar to the real-time quantitative qPCR (qPCR). 
Though, approaches based on isothermal amplification were also developed 
\cite{pabinger_survey_2014, ludlow_2014, rodiger_r_2015}. A first proposal for a 
dPCR-like approach and the use of the Poisson distribution to quantify the 
number of molecules on a ``sample'' was shown by Ruano \textit{et al.} 1990 
(PNAS) with the single molecule dilution (SMD) PCR \cite{ruano_haplotype_1990}. 
In 1999 Vogelstein \textit{et al.} (PNAS) described the first true dPCR 
\cite{vogelstein_digital_1999}. Since approximately ten years the dPCR is 
rapidly gaining momentum in the mainstream user-base and will likely have the 
same impact as the qPCR methodology. There is an intensive research on dPCR 
platforms with the overall aim to make to technology broadly usable, cheap, 
robust and to enable high sample throughput \cite{selck_increased_2013, 
huggett_qpcr_2015, morley_digital_2014}.

On the opposite to qPCR, dPCR consists of multiple amplifications occurring in 
numerous small ``partitions'' (e.g., nl volume droplets of water oil 
emulsions, chambers on micro structured chips). The result of dPCR is a binary 
vector describing states of partitions (positive in case of detected 
amplification, negative otherwise). The amplification in positive partitions 
indicates the presence of one or more template molecules. It is assumed that 
distribution of template molecules over partitions is described appropriately 
by the Poisson distribution. This probability distribution is parametrized 
using only single parameter, $\lambda$, which may be interpreted as the mean 
number of template molecules per partition. The relationship between 
$\lambda$, the number of positive partitions $k$ and the total number of 
partitions $n$ is as follows:
\begin{equation}
 \lambda = -\log{\left( 1 - \frac{k}{n} \right)}
\end{equation}

Knowing the $\lambda$ and volume of the single partition, the computation of 
the concentration of a template in the sample seems to be trivial, yet methods 
of analysis of dPCR results are still emerging.

The variety of existing procedures is disproportionate to the number of 
software packages dedicated to analysis of dPCR experiments. Most of the 
software comes in form of closed-source packages distributed by vendors of dPCR 
systems. The proprietary software without open source code prohibits validation 
the implementation of the assumed methodology and therefore has a limited usage 
in research. Moreover, vendors usually tie tightly software with their 
hardware, which hinders a comparison of results from different systems.

The lack of a dedicated software for analysis of dPCR results leads to the rapid 
development of custom scripts in \textbf{Mathematica} (Wolfram Research) 
\cite{strain_highly_2013}, \textbf{MS EXCEL} (Microsoft) 
\cite{dobnik_multiplex_2015} or \textbf{R} \cite{trypsteen_ddpcrquant_2015, 
dreo_optimising_2014}. In addition, web-servers for analysis of dPCR data are 
emerging as the open access bioinformatic pipeline, designated 
\textbf{definetherain} \cite{jones_low_2014}. However, these efforts have 
limited use, since they are tied to a very specific problem. Even if they 
introduce some level of abstraction, it is not documented well enough to 
permit usage in other workflows.

The described situation is unfavorable for studies involving dPCR data. The 
absence of graphical user interfaces prohibits majority of researchers from 
using the custom-made frameworks. Others have to implement methods on their own, 
shifting their focus from an investigation to programming. 

In 2013 we started the development of the \textit{dpcR} framework to perform 
analysis of dPCR experiments \cite{burdukiewicz_dpcr:_2013}. We have chosen R 
software environment \cite{Rcitation}, because it is already extensively used 
for studies of qPCR data \cite{ritz_qpcr_2008, rodiger_r_2015}. Furthermore, R 
is freely available for the MacOS, Linux/Unix and Windows operating systems. It 
supports literate programming (e.g., \textit{knitr}) and tools for reproducible 
research (e.g., \textit{rctrack}) \cite{liu_r_2014}. 

Since the R's command-line interface might not meet the need of all potential 
users, we added also a web server \textit{dpcReport} using the \textit{shiny} 
package. It allows access to the most of \textit{dpcR} functionalities through 
the Graphical User Interface. \textit{dpcReport} can be also installed as the 
stand-alone software.

\section{MATERIALS AND METHODS}

\subsection{Implementation of \textit{dpcR}}

%\textit{MBmca} \cite{rodiger_surface_2013} 
The \textit{dpcR} package is an open source extension to \textbf{R} and derives 
from \textbf{R} packages devoted to analysis of qPCR: \textit{qpcR} 
\cite{ritz_qpcr_2008} and \textit{chipPCR} \cite{roediger2015chippcr}. It 
employs object-oriented programming paradigm and the \texttt{underscore\_sep} 
naming convention \cite{Baaaath_2012}.

The results of dPCR experiments are stored using in the same class of 
objects regardless of their origin. This enables comparison of data 
from different systems using exactly the same framework. Subclasses further 
define the more specific features of objects as the spatial organization of 
chambers in case of the array-based dPCR.



Since the RDML format for dPCR is not yet established, we wrote several 
functions streamlining the data import from several systems (see Table 
\ref{table_formats}). To cover systems not yet included in the package, we 
created a ''raw data'' format. The user can manually arrange his data in this 
format and import it to the \textit{dpcR} package. Such input files can be 
created in a spreadsheet program or a text editor.

\end{tabular*}%

growing. CSV, comma separated values.}
\end{table}

Selected chamber dPCR systems rely on the proper preprocessing of qPCR data. 
This functionality is inherited from the \textit{qpcR} \textbf{R} package.

The main \textit{dpcR} functions (e.g., for analysis, 
simulations, plotting), several auxiliary functions (e.g., data import) and 
datasets of different dPCR systems are shown in the workflow of Figure 
\ref{workflow}. Figure~\ref{dpcR_framework}B illustrates the implementation of 
the \textit{dpcR} package. The function \textit{read\_dpcr}, \textit{qpcr2pp} 
and \textit{sim\_dpcr}, sets the input for all objects in the \texttt{dpcr} 
class. Central calculation specific to Poisson statistics in are performed 
independently in main functions. This class manages details of the dPCR analysis 
that are subsequently processed by \textit{dpcR} functions (e.g., 
reading/writing). Further details are explained in the supplementary 
information.

software framework structure. \textit{dpcR} is typically run from a desktop 
computer or a server. The software can be operated by an GUI/IDE application 
such as \textbf{RStudio} or \textbf{RKWard}. The \textit{dpcR} package has 
dependencies to other \textbf{R} packages (middle layer). The functionality 
shared between the packages enables repaid addition and expansion of 
functionality.}

available at each step of a dPCR data analysis.}
\label{workflow}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{workflow} provides an overview of important functions available at 
each step of a dPCR analysis. The first step is to import sample data into the 
\textbf{R} session. \textit{dpcR} accepts various data structures. This 
includes 
matrices of raw data and predefined structures provided by the different 
vendors 
(see Table \ref{table_formats}). Moreover, \textit{dpcR} accepts objects from 
the \textbf{R} workspace, which are converted via the \textit{read\_dpcr} 
function. Novel raw data structures are processed outside \textit{dpcR} using 
tools as described elsewhere. The data input to \textit{dpcR} should be raw 
data 
preferable, rather than gated summary data. The reasoning it to keep control 
over information loss for reproducible research.

\subsection{Documentation}

All functions of the \textit{dpcR} package have its own documentation package, 
which specifies the input types, classes, parameters and output formats. The 
documentation is available as standard \textbf{R} package reference manual and 
as vignette.

According to the dMIQE guidelines \cite{huggett_digital_2013} we used following 
notation:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\lambda$: average molecule numbers per partition,
 \item $k$: number of molecules per partition,
 \item $m$: total number of the molecules.
\end{itemize}

The following convention was kept, both in the documentation and in the 
package source code.

\subsection{Import and export of results figures and data}

\subsubsection{Reading or importing data}

\textbf{R} has a rich set of tool to arrange data in order to prepare them for 
the analysis. This is important when it comes to the question how experiments 
should be treated \citep{rodiger_r_2015}.



There numerous methods to import amplification curve data into the \textbf{R} 
workspace \cite{perkins_readqpcr_2012, pabinger_survey_2014, rodiger_r_2015}. 
Prior processing the data for dPCR analysis it is recommended to use dedicated 
\textbf{R} packages, such as \textit{chipPCR} \cite{roediger2015chippcr}, 
\textit{MBmca} \cite{rodiger_surface_2013}, \textit{qpcR} 
\cite{ritz_qpcr_2008}, 
to pre-process (e.g., removal of missing values, smoothing 
\cite{spiess_impact_2015}) the raw data.





\subsubsection{\textit{De novo} creation of dpcR objects from raw data}

In experimental setups user have the need to transform their raw data in a 
processable format. Since the \textbf{R} environment is cross-platform an 
ubiquitously used we aimed to ease this creation. In particular, this is 
relevant for reproducible research. The \textit{dpcR} framework covers the 
types 
typically used in laboratories.

\subsubsection{Public data sets}

\textit{dpcR} includes data sets or refers to additional R packages for testing 
purposes. The data originate from different dPCR and qPCR systems and were 
either published previously \cite{whale_comparison_2012, roediger2015chippcr, 
white_digital_2009, rodiger_r_2015, dorazio_statistical_2015} or \textit{de 
novo} generated.

\subsubsection{Export of analysis results}

Since \textit{dpcR} is based on the \textbf{R} environment all facilities for a 
report generation are usable as described before \cite{rodiger_r_2015}.

(see Table \ref{table_formats}).

A commonly available data exchange format is a perquisite for reproducible 
research. So far no cross-platform and system-independent format has been 
introduced for dPCR experiments. Therefore, we decided to use \texttt{RData} as 
our default format. \texttt{RData} works across all \textbf{R} environments and 
saves the variable names along the content of multiple variables, which can be 
restored in any workspace.

\subsection{Calculation of the uncertainty}

To determine the uncertainty of the estimated $\lambda$ we employ two 
previously 
published peer-reviewed methods \cite{dube_mathematical_2008, bhat_single_2009}.
The former is

\subsection{Poisson distribution}


\subsubsection{Moments}
It is assumed that results from the dPCR reaction follow the Poisson 
distribution. We implemented several functions for computation of the four 
first 
moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) of the distribution from which the 
data is sampled. They can be calculated empirically from the sample data or as 
functions of the estimated $\lambda$.

\subsubsection{Binomial approximation}
Since dPCR data contain binarized Poisson 
counts (all counts than zero are grouped together) it is possible to use 
methods 
appropriate for Binomial distribution. We employ several methods of computing 
confidence intervals (CI) for $\lambda$ value (e.g., Wilson method, 
Agresti-Coull method). They especially advantageous when $k$ is considerably 
smaller than $m$. They are beneficial for uncertainty calculation, because 
yielded CI's are not oscillating in such scenarios \cite{brown_2001}.

\subsection{Simulation}

The package covers two Simulation methods as described elsewhere in 
peer-reviewed publications. The method proposed by Dube~\textit{et al.}~2008 
\cite{dube_mathematical_2008} is based on distributing template molecules over 
partitions. The procedure in Jacobs~\textit{et al.}~2014 \cite{jacobs_2014} is 
more sophisticated and returns the fluorescence value obtains from droplet dPCR 
experiment including such phenomena as ``rain''. We also added streamlined and 
high-performing simulation in assumptions similar to Dube~\textit{et al.}~2008.

\subsection{Comparison of dPCR experiments}

In \cite{Burdukiewicz_tba} We implemented statistics based on Generalized 
Linear 
Models (GLM) and \textit{multiple ratio testing} (\textit{MRT}) to compare dPCR 
experiments. 

\subsection{Spatial distribution}

Array based dPCR experiments provide information about spatial distribution of 
partitions. Procedures belonging to spatial statistics verify if the status 
(positive, negative) of partition depends on its location. To address such 
questions, we implemented a Complete Spatial Randomness test for dPCR arrays. 
Moreover, we provide functionalities to export array dPCR data to \textbf{R} 
packages specialized in spatial statistics as described in 
\cite{Baddeley_2015}.

\subsection{Converting qPCRs to dPCRs}

High-Throughput qPCR is a well established and robust technology, which allows 
precise quantification of DNA material in high throughput fashion. However, the 
quantification by qPCR is challenging at very low and very high concentrations. 
In addition, pre-processing and data analysis is a affected by numerous adverse 
effects \cite{ruijter_2013, pabinger_survey_2014, spiess_impact_2015}. But the 
amplification curve real-time monitoring of the PCR product formation enables 
to 
determine quantification points (Cq), which can be binarized and analysed in 
the 
same way as dPCR experiments \cite{mojtahedi_2014}. This functionality is 
integral part of the \textit{dpcR} package.

\end{figure}

\section{RESULTS}

In the following section we show applications of the \textit{dpcR} package.

\subsection{Evaluation of dPCR comparison methods}

TBD

\subsection{Graphical user interface}

The critical functionalities of \textit{dpcR} package are implemented in the 
\textit{dpcReport} GUI. We aimed for a form factor (e.g., smart phone, tablet, 
desktop PCR) and operating system independent implementation of a graphical 
user 
interface. \textit{dpcReport} is based on \textit{shiny} technology and offers 
an intuitive user interface, which can be accessed by browsers (e.g., Google 
Chrome, Mozilla Firefox). Semi-interactive charts are based on \textit{ggplot2} 
(see Supplement).

The first panel ``Input file'' is responsible for loading the input data. Here 
part of data input structure (e.g., ID of experiments) may be accessed and 
modified during the analysis in the GUI. The second panel ``Data summary'' 
presents descriptive summary of the data in form of interactive tables and 
plots, offering filtering and selecting of individual runs. The third panel 
``Comparison of runs'' compares all runs of the experiment data. The fourth 
panel ``Advanced analysis'' consists of more specialized functionalities as 
testing individual arrays. All statistical methods used in the GUI are integral 
part of the \textit{dpcR} package and described in the methods section. The 
last 
panel enables flexible report generation. The report can be customized by 
including various sections, which are equivalents of the GUI panels.

An interesting feature of the \textit{shiny} technology is the automatic 
integration in environments, which support \texttt{HTML5} and 
\texttt{ECMAScript}. The \textit{dpcReport} integrates into Integration in 
third 
party software. This can be a modern web~browser or an \textbf{R} IDE/GUI such 
as \textbf{RKWard} (Figure~\ref{GUI_RKWard_1}) \cite{rodiger_rkward_2012} or 
\textbf{RStudio}. \textit{dpcReport} is a GUI tool for dPCR data mining and 
report generation. User can interact via a point-and-click interface on 
different tabs, which contain widgets such as sliders, input fields and check 
boxes. Other user input, such as parameters of test performed in GUI, are 
preserved and returned in the report to increase the reproducibility of the 
research study. The tabs cover relevant analysis steps for the report 
generation. An important option of \textit{dpcReport} is an export of the 
\textbf{R} source code used for the report generation is provided to the user. 
This code can be used for recreating the analysis in the \textbf{R} environment 
or prototyping more complicated workflows.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Vendor independent data analysis}

QX100 series is no longer available. Instead, the newer version QX200 protocol 
consisting of the QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 186-4002) and the 
QX200 droplet reader (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 186-4003) can be purchased, for which 
the protocol can be applied without changes. Alternative dPCR devices available 
from, e.g., RainDance Technologies, Life Technologies or JN Medsys 
\citep{mock_digital_2016}.

\subsection{Automatic report generation}

In \cite{rodiger_r_2015} we gave an example where we re-analyze droplet dPCR 
data from a Bio-Rad QX100 system with an early implementation of the 
\textit{dpcR} package. As recommended in the dMIQE guidelines 
\cite{huggett_digital_2013} we included key elements in the report.

\subsection{Availability}

The \textit{dpcR} framework is available as open source software package (GPL-3 
or later) as part of the Bioconductor project \cite{gentleman_2004}. The stable 
version is hosted at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dpcR and the source 
code is available from  https://github.com/michbur/dpcR.

\section{DISCUSSION}

Currently, there exist different dPCR analysis software solutions provided by 
the vendors. But most of the software packages are black boxes, which 
prevent deep insight into the data processing step. Other and we think that 
scientific software should be open \cite{ince_case_2012, 
rodiger_r_2015}. In addition, most of the software solutions are aimed to be 
used in very specific scenarios and a mutual exclusive to alternative platforms 
(e.g., droplet vs. chamber-based). We have chosen \textbf{R} because it is the 
\textit{lingua franca} in biostatistics and broadly used in other disciplines 
\cite{rodiger_r_2015}. We developed the \textit{dpcR} package, which is a 
software framework for analysis of dPCR. \textit{dpcR} provides the scientific 
community a broadly applicable tool for teaching purposes, data analysis and 
theoretical research based on simulations. Our software framework can be used 
to 
accelerate the development of new approaches to dPCR.

Functions included may be used to simulate dPCRs, perform statistical data 
analysis, plotting of the results and simple report generation. 

\section{CONCLUSION}

In conclusion, \textit{dpcR} provides means to understand how dPCR works, to 
design, simulate and analyze experiments, and to verify their results (e.g., 
confidence interval estimation), which should ultimately improve 
reproducibility. We have built what we believe to be the first unified, 
cross-platform, dMIQE compliant, open source software framework for analysing 
dPCR experiments. Our \textit{dpcR} framework is targeted at a broad user base 
including end users in clinics, academics, developers, and educators. We 
implemented existing statistical methods for dPCR and suggest the introduction 
of a standardized dPCR nomenclature. Our framework is suitable for teaching and 
includes references for an elaborated set of methods for dPCR statistics. Our 
software can be used for (I) data analysis and visualization in research, (II) 
as software framework for novel technical developments, (III) as platform for 
teaching this new technology and (IV) as reference for statistical methods with 
a standardized nomenclature for dPCR experiments. The framework enables the 
simulations and predictions of Poisson distribution for dPCR scenarios, the 
analysis of previously run dPCRs. Due to the plug-in structure of the software 
it is possible to build custom-made analysers.

We decided not to implement algorithms for clustering and ``rain'' (positive 
droplets) definition of droplet dPCR data. This is because, there are several 
\textbf{R} packages from flow-cytometer research. Implementations range from 
manual to automatic clustering \cite{le_meur_computational_2013, 
milbury_determining_2014, Malek15022015, trypsteen_ddpcrquant_2015}. Moreover, 
discussion with our peers and the literature suggest that a consensus of an 
appropriate method for dPCR is not available \cite{trypsteen_ddpcrquant_2015}.

Our open framework includes to invitation to the scientific community to join 
and support the development of \textit{dpcR}.
